# Basic Explanations

In order to develop a Sonarqube Plugin in Open source for creedengo, two basics should have been understood :

- How to develop a Sonarqube plugin
- Understand and work with the Gitflow
- How to develop in open-source mode

## Sonarqube Plugin

Here is official documentation to understand how to develop a sonar plugin : <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/developing-plugin/>
But ... we are going to help you more specifically for `creedengo` project in following sections.

### How a SonarQube plugin works

Code is parsed to be transformed as an [AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). This AST will allow you to access one or more nodes of your code.
For example, you‚Äôll be able to access of all the `for` loops, to explore content etc.

To better understand AST structure, you can use the [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) and select the language of the code you want to explore.

The JavaScript Sonar plugin works differently because it doesn't parse the code to transform it into an AST itself, it use the ESLint engine which will do it itself ([More information here](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-javascript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)). The good part is that it means that all Creedengo JavaScript rules are made available both to Sonar and to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) through an [Creedengo ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ecocode/eslint-plugin).

## Gitflow

What is GtiFlow and how it works : <https://medium.com/android-news/gitflow-with-github-c675aa4f606a>

## How to develop in open-source mode
please check following section

## Github Green-Code-Initiative

- common part (doc / tools) : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common>
- rules specification : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode>
- several mobile repositories
- several standard repositories
- several test project repositories

## Some rules references

### 115 web rules details

<https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices>

### 40+ android/iOS rules details

<https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile>

# Initialize local development

This section is to help you to install and configure your first environment to develop with us !!!

## Requirements

- `Docker` : <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>
- `Docker-compose` : <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
- `Java` JDK (and not only JRE) for Sonarqube plugin Development : <https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp>
- `Maven` for Sonarqube plugin Development : <https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>
- `Git` : <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>
- `JQ` : <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/>

### Method 1 - Automatic check (default method)

In the current repository, go to `tools/check_requirements` directory.
Next, execute script verification () :

For Mac or Unix OS : `./check_requirements.sh`

For Windows OS :

- execute script : `./check_requirements.bat`
- then check versions displayed

PS : if you have some problems with this script, please feel free to create a new issue here <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/issues>

### Method 2 - Manual check (if above "method 1" doesn't work)

If you want, you can check following file to know what are min and max versions for each tool : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/tools/check_requirements/config.txt>

Then launch check commands as follows (and check versions displayed) :

```sh
docker --version
docker-compose --version
javap -version
mvn --version
git --version
jq --version
```

## Get source code

Clone the project with (standard, mobile or/and common) : please see all availables repositories here <https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/repositories?type=all>

Example for Java plugin (with SSH) :
```sh
git clone git@github.com:green-code-initiative/creedengo-java.git
```

*WARNING* : if you are a new contributor (an not identified project `maintainer`), you have to use FORK / Pull Request System like explained here <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-develop-in-open-source-mode>

## Start local environment

You will find all steps to start and configure your local Sonarqube dev Environment here :

- 1st step - build your local plugin: <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-build-the-sonarqube-creedengo-plugins>
- 2nd step - launch local Sonarqube (with installation of previous local plugin built) : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-install-sonarqube-dev-environment>
- 3rd step - check that local environment is running perfectly : choose one of repositories with suffix "test-project" (ex : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-java-test-project/tree/main>)
  - next, launch script `tool_send_to_sonar.sh` (using previous secruitty token created on the first step)
  - finally, open local SonarQube GUI (<http://localhost:9000>) to verify if alone project raises creedengo errors

# Implement a new rule

## Requirements

please see section above `Initialize local development`

## Choose the rule you want to implement

Once your local environment is running, you can pick a rule waiting to be implemented.

Many ways to do this : 

- first and preferred way : pick a plugin in the table bottom and check if a rule is waiting to be implemented.

- second way : choose a rule in following tables 
  - [Web rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/blob/main/RULES.md)
  - [Android (Java) rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-android/blob/main/android-plugin/RULES.md)
  - [iOS (Swift) rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-ios/blob/main/RULES.md)
- third way : check rule ideas in Kanban project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1) and select implementable (or hardly implementable) ticket, and create an issue in the right language repositoyr
- fourth way : Go and give a hand to the [spotters team](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-challenge/blob/main/spotters.md) who will give you some rules to implement

## Check `Definition Of Done` for new rule implementation

For a new rule implementation, we strongly recommend you to follow this check-list :

- [ ] Check if rule doesn't exist in our referential rules list yet (`RULES.md` file or `creedengo-rules-specifications` module in `creedengo` repository)
- [ ] Create PR on the `creedengo` repository to add the new rule definition (`creedengo-rules-specifications`)
  - [ ] To choose the new rule id :
    - [ ] if rule is already existing in `RULES.md` file or in `creedengo-rules-specifications` module, please use the given rule id
    - [ ] if rule doesn't already exist in `RULES.md` file or in `creedengo-rules-specifications` module, please use a random number between 1000 and 1500 (ex : "EC1289") and use it (later, you will be asked to change it)
  - [ ] You can use SNAPSHOT version of `creedengo-rules-specifications` during your local rule implementation to go forward
- [ ] Implement rule in your local specific language repository with a reference to local SNAPSHOT of `creedengo-rules-specifications` module (previously, install it locally with maven command)
- [ ] Write Unit tests (and maximize code coverage)
- [ ] Update `RULES.md` file
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` file (inside `Unreleased` section)
- [ ] Create PR on the real test project to add a triggering case (check [local procedure](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md#start-local-environment))
- [ ] Fix potential SonarCloud issues / out-of-date warnings (report is sent after creating PR)
- [ ] In next review step, reviewer will ask you to use a specific id rule if you have chosen a random one

## Test your rule implementation

- First kind of test : Unit tests (please check `Definition of Done` above)
- Second kind of test : End-to-End tests in a real local environment (please check `Definition of Done` above and [local procedure](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md#start-local-environment) )

> Each rule needs to have scripts in a specific language (i.e. Python, Rust, JS, PHP and JAVA) in order to test directly inside Sonarqube that the rule has been implemented.
> To validate that the rule has been implemented, you need to execute a scan on those scripts. You will need sonar scanner: <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/>

# Publish your work

## Commit your code

Create a new branch following this pattern : <rule_id>-<language>
Example :

```sh
git checkout -b 47-JS
```

Commit your code :

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "your comments"
```

Push your branch :

```sh
git push origin <rule_id>-<language>
```

You may have to log with your account : <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>

## Open pull request

Once your code is pushed and tested, open a PR between your branch and "main" : <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>

## Review others development

Ask to people to review your PR. Once two people, at least, have reviewed, you can validate your PR
If you want to be reviewed, review others... It's a win/win situation

## Validation of a PR

Validate your PR or ask to someone who have the permissions to validate your PR.
Once PR validated, a github workflow is automatically launched. Thus, the new implemented code is also scan with our internal Sonar to check the implemented code quality.
Here is the SonarQube : <https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/green-code-initiative/projects>

## Close your rule

Once your PR is validated, your rule integrates creedengo. In <https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode/projects/1>, move it from the "In Progress" column to the "Done" column.
Well done.
